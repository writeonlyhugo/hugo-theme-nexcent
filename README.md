This is a Hugo starter template that simplifies the process of setting up a new
website project with Hugo, a popular static site generator, and Tailwind CSS, a
utility-first CSS framework. It comes pre-configured with essential files,
layouts, and styles, making it easy to start building your website right away.

## Features

- Hugo configured with a basic project structure
- Tailwind CSS for responsive and customizable styling
- Example content and layouts to kickstart your project
- Simple project organization to enhance maintainability

## Getting Started

To create a new Hugo project using this starter template, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Hugo and Node installed on your local
   machine. You can download and install Hugo from [Hugo's official
   website](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and Node from
   [Node's official website](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Clone this Starter Template**: Clone this repository You can do this via
   git or by downloading the repository as a ZIP archive and extracting it into
   your project folder.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/writeonlyhugo/hugo-template-tailwind .
   ```
   
   Don't forget to remove the `.git` folder, and to initialize your own git
   repository if needed.

5. **Customize Configuration**: Edit the `config.toml` file to configure your
   website settings and modify the example content in the `content` directory
   or replace it with your content.

6. **Build and Serve Your Site**: Install the NPM dependencies and start a
   development server to see your website in action.

   ```bash
   npm install
   hugo server -D
   ```

   Your site will be available at `http://localhost:1313`. You can make
   changes, and Hugo will automatically update the site as you save your files.

7. **Deployment**:
   When you are ready to deploy your site, you can use `hugo` to build the
   static files.

   ```bash
   hugo
   ```

   The generated files will be in the `public` directory, which you can deploy
   to your web hosting service of choice.
